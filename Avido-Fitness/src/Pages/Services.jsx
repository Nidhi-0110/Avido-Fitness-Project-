              <h4>Personal Training</h4>
              <p>
                The scope of practice for a personal trainer has a primary focus
                on prevention and involves enhancing components of health and
                fitness for the general, healthy population or those cleared for
                exercise. Proper exercise prescription may result in improved
                body composition, physical performance, heart condition, and
                health outcomes. The decision to hire a personal trainer may be
                related to a perceived health threat, a lack of knowledge, a
                personal belief in one's ability to begin and adhere to an
                exercise program, or some sort of psychological effect. Often
                clients will seek the guidance of a personal trainer for factors
                related to motivation and adherence. A personal trainer pays
                close attention to the client's exercise technique, workout
                routine, goals, values, and nutrition. Personal training in men
                and women has been shown to improve the benefit-to-concern ratio
                for exercise (decisional balance), and increase confidence to
                choose exercise in the face of other time demands (scheduling
                self-efficacy). Personal training results in higher strength,
                higher workout intensities, and higher perceived exertion during
                exercise.

              <h4>Strength Training</h4>
              <p>
                Strength training, also known as weight training or resistance
                training, is exercise designed to improve physical strength. It
                is often associated with the lifting of weights. It can also
                incorporate techniques such as bodyweight exercises (e.g.,
                push-ups, pull-ups, and squats), isometrics (holding a position
                under tension, like planks), and plyometrics (explosive
                movements like jump squats and box jumps). Training works by
                progressively increasing the force output of the muscles and
                uses a variety of exercises and types of equipment. Strength
                training is primarily an anaerobic activity, although circuit
                training also is a form of aerobic exercise. Strength training
                can increase muscle, tendon, and ligament strength as well as
                bone density, metabolism, and the lactate threshold; improve
                joint and cardiac function; and reduce the risk of injury in
                athletes and the elderly. For many sports and physical
                activities, strength training is central or is used as part of
                their training regimen. This article will cover many topics
                including principles and training methods, comparisons of
                different exercises, nutrition, history, and safety concerns.

              <h4>Functional Training</h4>
              <p>
                Functional Strength Training is a fitness approach designed to
                enhance the body's ability to perform everyday movements with
                ease and efficiency. Unlike traditional strength training that
                isolates specific muscle groups, functional training focuses on
                exercises that mimic real-life activities, such as lifting,
                squatting, and climbing. By engaging multiple muscles and joints
                simultaneously, functional strength training aims to improve
                overall body coordination, stability, and strength. Core
                exercises like squats, lunges, push-ups, and planks are commonly
                used, as well as tools like kettlebells, resistance bands, and
                medicine balls. Functional strength training is highly
                beneficial for improving daily life performance, reducing the
                risk of injury, and increasing flexibility and balance. It also
                provides a time-efficient workout by targeting multiple muscle
                groups at once, making it ideal for individuals seeking
                practical fitness solutions. This form of training is accessible
                to all fitness levels, from beginners to athletes, and can be
                adapted with bodyweight or added resistance, offering a
                comprehensive way to enhance functional fitness and overall
                health.

              <h4>CARDIO / HIIT TRAINING</h4>
              <p>
                Some form of cardiovascular (cardio) or aerobic exercise is
                necessary to condition your heart and lungs and build-up stamina
                for long days on the route. If you already enjoy swimming,
                cycling, running, or rowing, then increasing your time or
                intensity in these activities will be worthwhile training.
                Nevertheless, the most appropriate cardio preparation is to head
                outdoors on your bike as often as possible, progressively
                extending the time and distance. It is important to vary your
                training rides as the terrain on your trip can also change,
                especially on adventures with high Activity Level gradings, so
                incorporate interval training (see Fitness Plans) and include
                some hills in your routes.

              <h4>GROUP CYCLING</h4>
              <p>
                Strength exercises will help to prepare the main muscles used
                during cycling. On a bike, your core, legs and glutes (buttock
                muscles) work the hardest but with just a few, simple bodyweight
                exercises you can condition these muscle groups so they help you
                to maintain a better riding position, thereby keeping you
                comfortable on the ride for longer. Each Fitness Plan's strength
                exercises progress in difficulty, but if you find that your
                training plan's strength exercises are too challenging, try the
                options to make them easier (alternatively, try the progressions
                to make them harder) or simply follow the exercises on an easier
                plan. Slow and steady. Try to keep exercise movements controlled
                and steady, aiming to complete the recommended number of
                repetitions followed by a one to two-minute rest before moving
                onto the next set of repetitions of the same or different
                exercise. For all exercises, please take care not to flex the
                spine or round the shoulders. Maintain a good posture by
                focusing on the horizon, keeping shoulders back and chin and
                chest proud. Many of the exercises specifically work on
                strengthening core muscles; however, hold your core strong to
                help maintain your posture during other exercises.
